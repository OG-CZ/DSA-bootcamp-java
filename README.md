# DSA Bootcamp Java Journey

This repo contains my personal journey through solving **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems, along with minor **lecture code** and **Git/GitHub tutorials**.

## What's Inside?

- **Machine Problem Solutions**  
  Solved DSA problems, with clear and structured code.

- **_lectures Folder**  
  Contains lecture practice from the bootcamp series (DSA + Git/GitHub).

- **Progress-Driven Learning**  
  I add new solutions as i go through problems and video lectures. All code is written by me, and structured for readability.

---

## Topics Covered So Far
- Types of programming paradigm
- Introduction to Programming
- Basics of programming
- Git & GitHub 
- JAVA internal working (JDK, JRE, JVM)
- Stack and Heap working
- Basic Java Progam - (Control Flow Structure, Primitives vs Non Primitives vs String as immutable)
- Different Loops
- If Else Statements
- Arrays & ArrayList
- and a lot much more i can't remember every minute detail... just not summing to 50% is on this list
